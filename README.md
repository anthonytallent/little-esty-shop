## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.

## Requirements
- must use Rails 5.2.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- all code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and github projects to track progress on user stories
- must include a thorough README to describe the project
- must deploy completed code to Heroku
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment is not allowed
- Any gems added to the project must be approved by an instructor

Little-Esty-Shop description

Little Esty Shop shows our knowledge of Active Record and MVC relationships. 
What we were able to accomplish
- We got through all our user stories
- We got through all the api stories
- We learned a lot through trial and error
- We made PLENTY of mistakes along the way and have a better grasp on how to specifically use AR and MVC relationships

If we could go back and refactor the api methods out of our application helper and into other files where they would be more properly placed, we would.
Given more time we'd love to refactor more, especially as we learn more about rails and all of it inticacies.
